<h1> C-CDA Epic Parser </h1>
<h4>Built With Epic Version 8.5 Generated .xml  </h4>

A project for practice with more complex python programs. 
(Not Yet Complete), planning on making program more flexible To XML changes

Input .XML not included, will include once I get around to anonymizing the XML file. 

<i>If your hospital system uses a Epic System Patient Portal, you could use the program with the xml it creates. Just rename file to 'Input.xml'</i>
